            <p>Launch into coding with Mission Python, a space-themed guide to building a complete computer game in
                Python.
                You'll learn programming fundamentals like loops, strings, and lists as you build Escape!, an exciting
                game
                with
                a map to explore, items to collect, and tricky logic puzzles to solve. As you work through the book,
                you'll
                build exercises and mini-projects, like making a spacewalk simulator and creating an astronaut's safety
                checklist that will put your new Python skills to the test.</p>

            <h4>Mission</h4>
            <p>A mission is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by
                its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization. The purpose of a mission statement is to
                communicate the organisation's purpose and direction to its employees, customers, vendors, and other
                stakeholders. A mission statement also creates a sense of identity for its employees. Organizations
                normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their</p>

            <h4>Vission</h4>
            <p>Vision is a short, succinct, and inspiring statement of what the organization intends to become and to
                achieve at some point in the future, often stated in competitive terms. Vision refers to the category of
                intentions that are broad, all-intrusive and forward-thinking. It is the image that a business must have
                of its goals before it sets out to reach them. It describes aspirations for the future, without
                specifying the means that will be used to achieve those desired ends.</p>

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>Goal setting is a powerful process for thinking about your ideal future, and for motivating yourself to
                turn your vision of this future into reality.

                The process of setting goals helps you choose where you want to go in life. By knowing precisely what
                you want to achieve, you know where you have to concentrate your efforts. You'll also quickly spot the
                distractions that can, so easily, lead you astray.</p>

            <p class="develop2">Because Apex runs in a multitenant environment, the Apex runtime engine strictly
                enforces limits so that runaway Apex code or processes don’t monopolize shared resources. If some Apex
                code exceeds a limit, the associated governor issues a runtime exception that can’t be handled.</p>
